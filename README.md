An improvement on the "password manager" program using Flask -


A password manager that provides features such as:

Account creating and recovery system
A basic password rating system
Ability to delete accounts
Ability to create, generate, delete, and save passwords
Ability to see all entries
All through user interaction.

WARNING: Not recommended for serious use!

This program, while it may produce passwords that reach some degree of "safe", isn't to be used seriously as it provides no level of safety to the user's information.
