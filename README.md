## About

### Keep is a CRUD app that uses the Flask framework and SQlite database engine. An improvement on the CLI pseudo [password manager](https://github.com/shanewhiteman/password_manager) that I made in python.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Features

- ### Account creation ~~and recovery system~~
- ### ~~A basic password rating system~~
- ### ~~Ability to delete accounts~~
- ### ~~Ability to create, generate, delete, and save passwords~~
- ### ~~Ability to see all entries~~
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### <mark>WARNING</mark>: Not recommended for serious use!
----------------------------------------------------------
This application, while it may produce passwords that reach some degree of "safe", or even protect the user's information to a certain level as well, isn't to be used seriously as it doesn't implement any cyber security measures that holds a candle to other well known applications (bitwarden, lastpass, etc..)

This is a hobby project done in my free time.
